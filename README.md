## About

LeetCode is a platform for practicing coding problems related to data structures and algorithms. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to these problems, each organized by problem name and number.

Feel free to explore the solutions, ask questions, or provide feedback on the code. Additionally, you can use these solutions as references for your own learning journey.

## Solved Problems

Here are some of the problems I've solved:

1. [Problem 1: Two Sum](./problems/1-two-sum)
   - [Python Solution](./problems/1-two-sum/solution.py)
   - [Java Solution](./problems/1-two-sum/Solution.java)

2. [Problem 2: Add Two Numbers](./problems/2-add-two-numbers)
